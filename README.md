# master_thesis
This is a master thesis project related to the Master's Degree in ICT for Cybersystems @ University of Padova, IT

My job is to investigate current backup strategies in some DBMS (e.g. MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and the analysis of costs/benefits of each one.
Then, I will try to go beyond and develop some improvements.
